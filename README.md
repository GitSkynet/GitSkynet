### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a skilled .NET developer with 5 years of experience in both backend and frontend development. Over the last two years, I have specialized in backend development using .NET with Clean Architecture, Entity Framework, and database technologies such as SQL Server and Oracle Database. I am well-versed in developing scalable, robust solutions while adhering to SOLID principles and best practices.

My expertise also extends to front-end technologies, including ReactJS and Razor, as well as various architectural patterns like MVC and MVVM. I am committed to writing high-quality code and delivering solutions that meet business needs and user requirements.

I am currently expanding my knowledge by pursuing a Double Superior Degree in Web Application Development and Multiplatform Application Development, further enhancing my skills in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

I am actively seeking new professional opportunities where I can contribute to the development of impactful software solutions, leveraging my experience and passion for .NET development. If you're looking for a dedicated and experienced developer, I would be happy to discuss how I can bring value to your team.

Technologies I work with: .NET, C#, Entity Framework, LINQ, SQL Server, Oracle Database, Razor, MVC, MVVM, SOLID principles, Clean Architecture, Testing (Moq), JavaScript, ReactJS, MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, NodeJS), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, WordPress, Drupal, PHP, Bash scripting.
