### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ 
I love programming, creating websites, applications, programs ... I am in love with Arduino and raspberry, android, applications, web development ... 
I love the DIY world and I have several projects made with raspberry; also, I am always learning something new or improving what is known!
A year ago I decided to redirect my professional career and dedicate myself to the development of web applications and cross-platform applications.
I like to learn continuously, give shape to my ideas and make them come true.
