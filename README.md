### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a professional .NET developer with 5 years of experience in backend and frontend development. Over the last two years, I have specialized in backend development using .NET, Clean Architecture, Entity Framework, SQL Server, and Oracle Database.

On the frontend side, I work with ReactJS, MVC, and MVVM patterns, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript. My experience includes creating dynamic and responsive web applications, leveraging Razor templates to deliver efficient and user-friendly interfaces.

Currently, I work in the logistics sector, developing automation systems for order fulfillment factories. My role focuses on optimizing processes, designing scalable architectures, and implementing solutions that improve operational efficiency.

In addition to my professional experience, I am constantly enhancing my skills through online courses and personal projects. I have a strong command of Ubuntu Server, including Docker setups, server interconnections, VPN creation, and home server deployment. I am also exploring the world of IoT through Arduino projects, continuously expanding my technical expertise.

Technologies I work with:
.NET, C#, Clean Architecture, Entity Framework, LINQ, SQL Server, Oracle Database, ReactJS, MVC, MVVM, Razor, JavaScript, TypeScript, Docker, Ubuntu Server, VPN setup, IoT (Arduino), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

I am passionate about crafting high-quality software solutions and staying updated with the latest advancements in technology. With a proven track record of delivering robust and scalable systems, I thrive in dynamic environments where I can make a meaningful impact.
